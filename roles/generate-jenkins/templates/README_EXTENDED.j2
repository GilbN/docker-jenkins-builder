### Seccomp

Modern GUI desktop apps (including some flavors of terminals) have issues with the latest Docker and syscall compatibility, you can use Docker with the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` setting to allow these syscalls or try [podman](https://podman.io/) as they have updated their codebase to support them

### Keyboard Layouts

This should match the layout on the computer you are accessing the container from.
The keyboard layouts available for use are:

* da-dk-qwerty- Danish keyboard
* de-ch-qwertz- Swiss German keyboard (qwertz)
* de-de-qwertz- German keyboard (qwertz) - **OSK available**
* en-gb-qwerty- English (UK) keyboard
* en-us-qwerty- English (US) keyboard - **OSK available** **DEFAULT**
* es-es-qwerty- Spanish keyboard - **OSK available**
* fr-ch-qwertz- Swiss French keyboard (qwertz)
* fr-fr-azerty- French keyboard (azerty) - **OSK available**
* it-it-qwerty- Italian keyboard - **OSK available**
* ja-jp-qwerty- Japanese keyboard
* pt-br-qwerty- Portuguese Brazilian keyboard
* sv-se-qwerty- Swedish keyboard
* tr-tr-qwerty- Turkish-Q keyboard

### Hardware Acceleration (Ubuntu Container Only)

Many desktop application will need access to a GPU to function properly and even some Desktop Environments have compisitor effects that will not function without a GPU. This is not a hard requirement and all base images will function without a video device mounted into the container.

#### Intel/ATI/AMD

To leverage hardware acceleration you will need to mount /dev/dri video device inside of the conainer.

```text
--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri
```

We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device.

#### Nvidia

Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:
https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the container.

#### Arm Devices

Best effort is made to install tools to allow mounting in /dev/dri on Arm devices. In most cases if /dev/dri exists on the host it should just work. If running a Raspberry Pi 4 be sure to enable `dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d` in your usercfg.txt.

### Media folders

We have set /music and /downloads as optional paths, this is because it is the easiest way to get started. While easy to use, it has some drawbacks. Mainly losing the ability to hardlink (TL;DR a way for a file to exist in multiple places on the same file system while only consuming one file worth of space), or atomic move (TL;DR instant file moves, rather than copy+delete) files while processing content.

Use the optional paths if you dont understand, or dont want hardlinks/atomic moves.

The folks over at servarr.com wrote a good [write-up](https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide#consistent-and-well-planned-paths) on how to get started with this.
